# General Coding Guidelines

- Use Godot 4.4 features
- Use GDScript for all scripts
- Prioritize readability and maintainability in all code
- Ensure function and variable names are clear and descriptive
- Use concise, meaningful comments for complex logic
- Prefer to connect signals in scenes rather than in scripts directly
- Use `snake_case` for directories and files
- Use `CamelCase` for Node names

# General Coding Guidelines
- Godot version is 4.4
- Use GDScript for all development
- Prioritize readability and maintainability in all code
- Ensure function and variable names are clear and descriptive
- Use *String Name* and *Node Path* literals where applicable
- Use type hints (`: Type`)
- Prefer to connect signals in scenes rather than in scripts, unless required
- Follow official GDScript style guide

## Naming Conventions
- Use snake_case for directories/files and variable/function names in scripts
- Use CamelCase for class names (e.g., `Player`, `Interactable`)
- Use snake_case for function names (e.g., `activate`, `deactivate`)
- Use snake_case for variable names (e.g., `is_active`, `has_error`)
- Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants (e.g., `MAX_HEALTH`, `DEFAULT_SPEED`)

## Documentation
- Add documentation comments (`##`) to each function
- Use concise, meaningful comments for complex logic

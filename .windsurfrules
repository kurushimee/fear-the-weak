## Project Context
- 2D game
- Uses Godot 4.4
- Uses only GDScript as the scripting language

## Code Style and Structure
- Write concise, technical GDScript code with accurate type hinting
    - Always specify function return type (except lambda functions)
- Use *String Name* and *Node Path* literals where applicable
- Use composition
- Separate responsibility between scripts
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., is_loading, has_error)
- Follow official GDScript style guide conventions

## Naming Conventions
- Use snake_case for directories/files and variable/function names in scripts
- Use CamelCase for class/node names
- Prefix Godot functions (e.g., _process, _physics_process) and signal handlers (e.g., _on_body_entered) with an underscore
    - No prefix for own functions (e.g. handle_something)
- Use type hints

## Error Handling
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Log errors appropriately for debugging
- Provide user-friendly error messages

## Documentation
- Document code architecture
- Don't include comments unless it's for complex logic
